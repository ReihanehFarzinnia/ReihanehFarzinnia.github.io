Welcome :)

I'm Reihaneh, a PhD student at The University of Manchester, supervised by [Prof Neil Humphrey](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/neil.humphrey) and [Dr Loiuse Black](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/louise.black). 

I am interested in how we measure and model mental health difficulties, particularly among young adults. Currently, I am working on the application of Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) and Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA; or, as Dan Bauer and Patrick Curran said themselves, the world's worst acronym!) in adolescent mental health research. I will start the second year of my Phd in October 2025, and I will blame Patrick Curran and Greg Hancok if my PhD goes wrong, as I heard about IDA in [Quantitude](https://quantitudepod.org) podcast!

I am also interested in contributing to the improvement of psychological science through open science practices and promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research.

I am doing my PhD as part of the [BeeWell](https://beewellprogramme.org/) team, and I am also working part-time as a research assistant on the [So.Me](https://www.so-me-study.org/) project. You can learn more about these cool projects and my role in them in the [Research Projects](/projects/) section.

You can also explore my [CV](/cv/), publications, and other activities!
