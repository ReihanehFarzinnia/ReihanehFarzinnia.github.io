# About Me!

Welcome :)

I'm Reihaneh, a PhD student at The University of Manchester. 

Broadly, I am interested in how we measure mental health difficulties, particularly among young adults. 

Currently, I am working on the application of Interactive Data Analysis (IDA) and Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA; or, as Dan Bauer and Patrick Curran said themselves, the world's worst acronym!) in adolescent mental health research. 

I will start the second year of my Phd in October 2025, and I will blame Patrick Curran and Greg Hancok if my PhD goes wrong, as I heard about IDA in the Quantitude podcast! 


Here, you can explore my CV, publications, and research projects!
