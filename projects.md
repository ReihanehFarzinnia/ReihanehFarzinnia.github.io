[BeeWell](https://beewellprogramme.org/) was developed in response to a growing concern for the wellbeing of young people in the UK. At #BeeWell, we are working with young people, secondary schools and a coalition of partners across local government, health and the voluntary sector. Together we listen to young people about their wellbeing, and drive action in response to what they say. Since 2021, weâ€™ve listened to the voices of more than 130,000 young people across Greater Manchester and Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Portsmouth and Southampton, working with around 300 schools. 

[So.Me](https://www.so-me-study.org/) is developing a measure to understand young people's use of social media and its relationship to mental health and wellbeing. We aim to both advance our understanding of young people's experiences of using social media and champion best practice and novel methods in scale development through centring young people's voices throughout the research process.
